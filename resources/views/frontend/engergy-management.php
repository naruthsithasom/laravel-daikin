                                With economic activities taking place actively across borders, the Paris Agreement and the SDGs
(Sustainable Development Goals) for the realization of a sustainable society were adopted by the United
Nations, and the world began to move sharply. Also, the perspective on which investors choose companies
has changed. With the launch of Climate Action 100+, which requires companies to disclose more
information on climate change, there is a growing view of assessing risks and opportunities from a longterm perspective and assessing companies that are working towards a global goal. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Under these circumstances, we agreed with the Paris Agreement and set up a long-term environmental vision to achieve "zero CO2 emissions" toward 2050. Promote CO2 emissions
reduction with solutions that utilize IoT / AI technology, such as enhancing energy saving performance by strengthening cooperation between air conditioners and buildings, as well as
energy saving products and production activities, development and diffusion of low warming refrigerants, as well as enhancing energy saving performance. You Furthermore, we aim to
achieve zero CO2 emissions by promoting refrigerant recovery and regeneration in the market. While reducing greenhouse gases with various stakeholders, we provide our mission of safe
and healthy air space.
